# Privacy-First Video Blur Algorithm

## Description

We plan to develop an algorithm to blur or anonymize individuals in the footage through encryption, thus protecting their privacy. The blurred footage will be the only footage accessible if hacked, since the original video will be encrypted. To unblur the video, only people with the proper cryptographic key will be able to unblur the image and access the original video files. We will surround our discussion on the choices made in designing our algorithm, touching on topics such as privacy, fairness, and surveillance.
